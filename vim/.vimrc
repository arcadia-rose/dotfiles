" The following set up the foundation of file-searching.
"
" The RG command opens a new vertical pane containing output
" from running `rg` against your input arguments.  By default,
" the buffer will only list files containing the text found and
" not include the matched text itself.
" This is useful for finding definitions of classes, methods, etc.
"
" The FD command opens a new vertical pane containing output
" from running the `fd` command against your input arguments.
" This is basically just a simpler and faster way of invoking `find`.
"
" The <leader>f binding will open the file under the cursor in a
" new horizontal pane.  This plays nicely with the longer vertical
" pane opened by RG and FD.  Since the two commands list files on
" separate lines, vim doesn't have a hard time finding the end of the
" filename.
